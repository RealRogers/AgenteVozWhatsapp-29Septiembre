-- Migration: 20260928000000_llm_turn_reservation
-- Agente WhatsApp — atomic per-contact hourly LLM turn reservation
--
-- checkRateLimits' per-contact hourly turn limit was a classic
-- check-then-act race: two concurrent requests for the same contact both
-- read a count under the ceiling before either had written its own
-- llm_usage event, so both were authorized. Verified with 2 concurrent
-- requests against the real function: both allowed, counter ended up at
-- 21 turns with the limit set to 20.
--
-- reserve_llm_turn() closes this the same way claim_next_batch() already
-- does for batch claiming (20260608000002_buffer_rpc.sql): the count-check
-- and the row that makes the NEXT caller's count-check see this one both
-- happen inside a single function call, serialized per (workspace, contact)
-- via pg_advisory_xact_lock so two concurrent calls for the SAME contact
-- can't both pass. The lock is scoped to the transaction wrapping this one
-- RPC call (milliseconds) — NOT held across the LLM round-trip, which the
-- stateless Supabase REST client couldn't hold a lock across anyway.
--
-- The reservation is a real llm_usage row with total_tokens=0, inserted
-- immediately; cost-tracker.ts's recordLlmUsage() later updates that same
-- row with the real token counts instead of inserting a new one. If the
-- LLM call fails before recordLlmUsage runs, the reservation stays at 0
-- tokens — correct, since a turn slot really was spent on the attempt even
-- though no tokens were billed.
