-- ============================================================================
-- Migration: 20260930000005_appointments_hl_unique_index
-- One local appointment per HighLevel appointment, per workspace.
--
-- The local rows are a cache of HighLevel's appointments: every read of an
-- appointment from HighLevel is written back to its row (an upsert on this
-- pair), creating it for one only HighLevel knew (booked through its link, or
-- by staff). Nothing kept two rows from holding the same HighLevel id.
--
-- Existing duplicates would make CREATE UNIQUE INDEX fail and stop db push.
-- Instead, in each duplicated (workspace_id, hl_appointment_id) group one row
-- keeps the id — a live one (booked, confirmed) before any other, then the one
-- touched most recently — and the others are unlinked (hl_appointment_id →
-- NULL). Their data stays; only updated_at moves, because
-- trg_appointments_updated_at stamps every UPDATE. A WARNING lists how many,
-- with up to 20 of their ids. Lock, dedupe and index run as one statement
-- (the CLI doesn't wrap a migration in a transaction), so the table is locked
-- against writes until the index exists and no new duplicate slips in.
--
-- Total, not partial: NULLs never collide in a unique index (rows booked
-- without HighLevel carry no id), and a partial one could not back the
-- write-back's ON CONFLICT from PostgREST (42P10). CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS
-- only compares names, so an earlier partial index by this name (a test
-- database that ran a draft of this migration) is dropped and recreated.
-- Without CONCURRENTLY: it can't run inside the DO block's transaction.
